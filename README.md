This project combines both the use of PostGreSQL and python to perform exploratory data analysis. The project first starts with utilizing PostGreSQL in PGAdmin4 in order to combine multiple tables together into one using the "inner join" feature. Once the ideal table is built, it is carried over into juypter notebook, where python's powerful libraries can be taken advantage of to perform exploratory data analysis and visualize relationships among variables.

PostGreSQL is used to combine 3 tables; the main table containing songs and each of their attributes, a smaller table containing the release dates of each title track, and a smaller table containing all girl and boy groups and their year of debut. Once the ideal table is made, it is brought into juypter notebook, where you can now analyze trends in the attributes over time. You can also analyze trends based on the gender of the group. 

Unfortunately when you try to view the main project file, you will get an error message saying "this file took too long to render." The reason for this is still unknown, but the best way to overcome this is to go to https://nbviewer.org/ and copy and paste the project file's link onto it:

NB viewer turns the notebook file into a static HTML web page.
